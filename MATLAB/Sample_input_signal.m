%% Simple Model of Antenna Array
% The purpose of this script is to create a model of the signals that we 
% might receive from the radio location collars. We assume that, since the
% antennas are far enough away from the source, we see the incoming waves
% as plane waves. We also will only work in two dimensions, which is as if
% the waves and the antennas are on the same plane.
%
% Hopefully from this we can build a fake set of signals that allow us to
% understand how to interpret phase changes to find the direction of the
% wave propagation.
